# Deployment Guide - Testing on Another Computer

## Option 1: Build Standalone Executable (Recommended)

### On Your Development Computer:

1. **Install PyInstaller** (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. **Build the executable**:
```bash
python scripts/build_installer.py
```

This will create:
- `dist/SummarixAI/` - Folder with all files
- `dist/SummarixAI/SummarixAI.exe` - Executable file (Windows)

3. **Transfer the entire `dist/SummarixAI` folder** to the other computer:
   - Copy via USB drive
   - Upload to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Transfer via network share

### On the Other Computer:

1. Copy the `dist/SummarixAI` folder to any location
2. Double-click `SummarixAI.exe` to run
3. **Note**: The models must be included in the `resources/models/` folder

---

## Option 2: Install from Source

### On the Other Computer:

1. **Install Python 3.8+**:
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Clone or download the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevVanguard/SummarixAIV1.git
cd SummarixAIV1
```

Or download as ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

3. **Set up virtual environment**:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Download models**:
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

6. **Run the application**:
```bash
python run.py
```

---

## Option 3: Create Installer Package

### For Windows:

1. **Install Inno Setup** (optional, for professional installer):
   - Download from: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
   - Use the `installer.iss` script generated by `build_installer.py`

2. **Or create a simple ZIP package**:
   - Zip the entire `dist/SummarixAI` folder
   - Include instructions in a README.txt

---

## Important Notes:

### Model Files:
- The T5-small model files (~250MB) must be included
- They should be in: `resources/models/t5-small/`
- If missing, run `python scripts/download_models.py` on the target computer

### Dependencies:
- The executable should be self-contained
- No Python installation needed if using Option 1
- All dependencies are bundled in the executable

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] PDF file upload works
- [ ] Extractive summarization works
- [ ] Abstractive summarization works (requires model)
- [ ] Export functions work (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- [ ] No internet connection required (offline mode)

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "Model not found" error:
- Run `python scripts/download_models.py` to download models
- Or copy `resources/models/` folder from development computer

### Import errors:
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)

### Executable won't run:
- Check Windows Defender/Antivirus (may block new executables)
- Try running as Administrator
- Check if all DLLs are included in the dist folder

---

## Quick Test Script:

Create a simple test to verify installation:

```python
# test_installation.py
import sys
from pathlib import Path

print("Testing SummarixAI Installation...")
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")

try:
    from src.core.pdf_processor import PDFProcessor
    print("✓ PDF processor imported")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ PDF processor error: {e}")

try:
    from src.core.extractive.textrank import TextRankSummarizer
    print("✓ Extractive summarizer imported")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Extractive summarizer error: {e}")

try:
    from src.core.abstractive.summarizer import AbstractiveSummarizer
    print("✓ Abstractive summarizer imported")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Abstractive summarizer error: {e}")

try:
    from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication
    print("✓ PyQt6 imported")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ PyQt6 error: {e}")

print("\nInstallation test complete!")
```

Run with: `python test_installation.py`
